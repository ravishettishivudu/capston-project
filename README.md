# Task 5 — Capstone Project & Incident Response

🎓 This was my **final task** in the ApexPlanet Internship. I applied everything I learned from Tasks 1 to 4 to complete a full real-world simulation of a cyber attack and how to respond to it.
👨‍💻 Intern Details
- *Name:* Ravishetti Shivudu  
- *Intern ID:* APSPL2519202  
- *Internship Domain:* Network Security  
- *Organization:* Apex Planet Pvt. Ltd.

## 💻 What I Did:
- Scanned my test network with **Nmap** and **OpenVAS**.
- Exploited vulnerable services using **Metasploit**.
- Collected evidence like usernames, passwords, and traffic logs.
- Built a basic **SIEM system** using the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat).
- Detected attack patterns from logs.
- Created an **Incident Response Report** including containment, analysis, and recovery steps.

## 📁 Files Included:
- `Task5_Capstone_Final_Report.docx` — Full final report.
- `screenshots/` — SIEM dashboard and scan results.
- `scan-results/` — Nmap and vulnerability outputs.
- `SIEM_Config/` — Config files for Filebeat, Logstash.
- `Incident_Playbook.md` — Steps to respond to the incident.
- `demo_video_link.txt` — Link to my final project demo video.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- Wireshark
- OpenVAS
- ELK Stack (Filebeat, Logstash, Kibana)

## 🧠 What I Learned:
- How to test systems from start to end (scan → exploit → detect → respond).
- How to monitor real-time logs and create alerts.
- How cybersecurity teams handle incidents in real life.
